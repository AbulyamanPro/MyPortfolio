            <h4>HTML & CSS</h4>
            <p>
                HTML and CSS are the two languages that I learned after C++, and I felt like they are the easiest
                languages of the world, but, now I think that CSS is the world's most complicated language, although I
                have learned most of it now.</p>
            <p>
                How I learned them? Well, that's a great question. I learned these from various sources, the dominant of
                which is 'Books'. I have learned from W3Schools also but not so much.
                I learned CSS from books, but not as much as from Youtube.

            <h4>Javascript</h4>
            <p>
                Javascript is the second-last language that I learned. It is almost identical to C++, therefore it
                did'nt take me much time to learn it.
                I learned Javascript from Codecademy, and I like the practice-driven learning method of Codecademy.

            <h4>React</h4>
            <p>
                React is the only library that I learned to use. I like it's component driven aproach to web
                development. I felt the use of components before I came to know React, but when my friend from Poland
                told me about it, I was surprised, started learning it imediately.
                I learned React also from Codecademy because, again, I like the practice-driven learning method of
                Codecademy.

            <h4>PHP and SQL</h4>
            <p>
                I learned these both from a book, but they were introduced to me by Dr. David J. Malon, from Harvard
                university in his introduction to Computer Science 'CS50' course. Later I learned them from the book
                'Learning PHP, MySQL, & Javascript, JQUERY, CSS & HTML5' by Robin Nixon. Thanks' to all my teachers.
